            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Learning Journey</h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                This website was built as part of our learning PHP journey. Our primary goal
                was to understand the fundamentals of PHP while creating a functional web application. Through this
                project, we explored how PHP interacts with databases, handles form submissions, and generates dynamic
                content.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                Additionally, we used Laracasts as a valuable resource to guide our learning process. Laracasts is an
                amazing website with a lot of tutorials and classes to guide new and experienced learners into the php world.
                By applying the concepts learned, we were able to build a simple yet effective note-taking application.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why PHP?</h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                PHP is a widely-used server-side scripting language that is essential for web development. Because of that,
                our project used PHP to create a simple but robust and maintainable web application.
